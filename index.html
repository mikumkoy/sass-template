                    <p>Ancient religious cults drank psychedelic brews to commune with deities. Roman rulers and politicians were required to undergo psychedelic treatment prior to serving in the highest ranks. And by the 1950s, mainstream researchers were studying the beneficial effects of drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA. But promising results were cut short when governments deemed these natural substances to be as dangerous and addictive as heroin and crack cocaine.</p>

                    <h4>Silo Pharma has seen the immense potential of the psychedelic research market and has set its sights on commercializing life-saving treatments using the benefits of psychedelics.</h4>
                    <p>With recent advancements in scientific understanding and popular movements to legalize cannabis, psychedelic substances seem close to getting the legal attention (and deregulation) they deserve. Within the last few years the state of Oregon and the city of Denver have decriminalized psilocybin mushrooms. Other states are looking to do the same. Understanding that the Psychedelic market is predicted to boom as the government deregulates access to psychedelics, Silo Pharma has already engaged in a number of exclusive projects using substances such as psilocybin, MDMA, and ketamine.</p>
